# Raspberry-Pi-Pico-DHT11-Data-Transmission-to-ThingSpeak-using-MicroPython
This project demonstrates how to use a Raspberry Pi Pico to read temperature and humidity data from a DHT11 sensor and send the data to ThingSpeak for remote monitoring and analysis. The code is written in MicroPython, a lean and efficient implementation of Python 3 designed specifically for microcontrollers.
